## Final Notes

This project was quite challenging and took a lot of effort, but I'm proud to say that I succeeded in the end. It took me a while to figure things out since I was new to some of the concepts, but I managed to implement all the necessary JavaScript functionalities resulting in all of my intended requirements being present, smooth, and accounted for. Overall, I'm really happy with the design and the final product, and I feel like I learned a lot in the process."
